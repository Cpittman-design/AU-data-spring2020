As the 2020 census approaches, the Census Bureau pushes to reach the hard-to-count population.

For the District of Columbia, college students are just among others whose participation is a priority. The 2010 census report showed that the [college-age population](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-10973-8_5.pdf), from 18 to 24, had a net over-count, while other age groups showed a net under-count.  

The over-count in the [2010 census](https://www.census.gov/coverage_measurement/pdfs/g04.pdf) attributed to college students being double-counted at their college residence and their parents’ home. 

College students who live away from home should count themselves at the on- or off-campus residence where they live and sleep most of the time. And college students who are living at home most of the time should be counted at their home addresses.

## District of Columbia Population

In 2010, D.C.s population was about 605,085 and the census count reported lower than its actual population, according to the Census Coverage Measurement Estimate report. 

There are several concerns about whether the 2020 census report will under-count D.C. residents again.

As the district continues to grow, it makes it hard to accurately count all residents. Since the 2010 census report, D.C.’s population from [2010 to 2019](http://worldpopulationreview.com/states/district-of-columbia-population/#population-data) has grown by 106,486. The District’s population has made more than a 7.5% increase since the 2010 census. However, for every increase of 100,000 in D. C’s. population, the growth rate decreases by about 8,540 residents.

Ensuring an accurate count helps federal funding. It is the main source of higher education. The funds will go to students at public, private and for-profit colleges and researchers at public and private universities.

And because of the difficulty in counting students, the Census Bureau will reach out to college campuses to collect information about students living on campus.


“The mayor wants 80% participation across D.C.,” says Eilis Jones, the board member of the American University Census Count Committee.

American University is just one of many colleges in the District that will provide the Census Bureau their students’ names, locations on campus, and primary home address.

In 2010, more than a third of students in college housing were counted through administrative records provided by the university.

Jones says that they will not provide additional data the census is requesting because of safety concerns for their students, even though other colleges are releasing student’s information, ethnicity, gender, race, birth, etc.


## Challenges with the Census

Distrust in the government, information explosion, and identity are just a few concerns with college students. The 2020 census form was [revised](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml) to inform schools that they can furnish demographic data that ask about the student’s sex and race because they could not release that information without the student’s consent.  

We’ve received so many rants from students about the government collecting data, says Jones. Her team asked a couple of students on campus if they knew about the census report. 

Mirielle Pyram, a sophomore at American University, says a concern for her has been confidentiality.

“You want to make sure your private information is protected and many people I know doubt that,” she says. 

Even though Pyram has some doubts about the census, she says that she will look further into it and see how it can benefit her community, especially those who are a part of the marginalized population in D.C.

College students should be counted on the Census according to where they live and sleep most of the time as of April 1, 2020. A complete and accurate count of students determines the funds and resources of that state or district. 

The 2020 census count will help determine the allocation of $1.5 trillion in federal spending.

For D.C., the federal government uses census data to allocate annually more than [$6 million](https://gwipp.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2181/f/downloads/IPP-1819-3%20CountingforDollars_DC.pdf) for schools, Medicaid, food assistance, and other programs. However, for the 2010 census, D.C. had the second-highest quota of residents who were not counted among other major cities. 

## Hard-to-Count Population

(Chart)

In 2010, about 13% of 18 to 24-year-olds made up the D.C. population. Amongst that group there were about 37,023 males and 44,830 females. Within the last 10 years, both the female and male population has decreased as D.C’s general population has grown. In 2019, D.C saw its lowest population rate for 18 to 24-year-olds, making up only 8.5% of its population.

The data of college-aged people (18-24) has changed over time. In the 2000 and 2010 census, there was a net over-count in these age groups. However, in earlier census data, there was a net under-count for this age group as well. This group also had a relatively [high omission rates](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-10973-8_5.pdf) in which it may not be counted at all for several factors being. 

People aged 18 to 24 are over-represented in both groups. They are just hard to count. 

Even though we’ve seen these numbers decrease in D.C., as the general population grows, the college enrollment increases.

The last census in 2010 found that over 2.5 million students live in dorms or on-campus fraternity or sorority houses, according to a recent reporting from [The Associated Press](https://apnews.com/7006e5c25ab67785d36cf55b862c5613).

Between [2010-2015](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d16/tables/dt16_304.10.asp?current=yes), about 13-15% of the D.C. population enrolled in college. During the 2010 census report, 91,992 students were counted for. 

## The Population is Changing

“The student population is changing,” says Jeremy Lowe, assistant director of American University admissions, and he thinks it’s because more students are being represented in D.C. nationally. 

He says it’s important for campuses to get a sense of who their residents are. Therefore, an official report like the census can go a long way to shedding light on where resources and funding need to go.

“AU has a responsibility because we’re a part of the D.C. community. I think there is a responsibility that we share the burden in educating students and providing access to quality education for higher education here,” he says. 

Lowe would like for AU to do a census of its own to know how to distribute and allocate resources to support everyone equitably in their community. 

The 2020 Census goal is to ensure that all students are able to participate and be counted for. However, the push for accurate numbers of college students in D.C. will be inadequate due to the challenges this age group face. The issue isn’t only trusting that their data is being treated confidentially, but the questions on the census and ultimately what information the school will release.
