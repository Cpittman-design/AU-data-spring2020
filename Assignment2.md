<p>Even in the fastest-growing industry influencer marketing, black women are bringing attention to the pay disparity on social platforms, especially youtube. Black social media influencers are the latest to see the disparity in equal pay in an industry where they hold the spending power – as well as leading in diverse conversations and setting trends. I’m interested in learning more about the gender pay gap in the influencer marketing industry based on the topics discussed by black women on youtube. </p>

Here are the features I'll be collecting, and an explanation of why:

* The top five paid black women youtubers.
* How often youtube influencers create content and post.
* The number of youtube followers.
* Where do most of them live.
* What are the top categories/topics on Youtube.
* How much influencers make from their social following, views, and likes.
* The average influencer age, race, and gender. 
* How much time and effort goes into creating content for youtube videos.
* The total number of channel views.
* What determines an influencer value to brands/companies.
* The most important social media channel for influencer marketing (budget and average cost marketers spend).
* Where are majority black women youtubers from.
* How long have they been youtube infuencers. 
* How much do black women youtubers get paid  as their male and female counterparts. 

<p>I will collect data from the top black women youtubers, gathering information from their youtube and other social channels, and reading articles about black social media influencers, along with reading influencer marketing studies. </p>
