<p>A New Great Migration: How black migration patterns shape where black women live today. This is a topic that I would like to explore following the Black Migration between the early 1900s where millions of blacks left the rural south for the cities of the North, Midwest, and West. Over time, many black cities were developed within existing cities due to racial disparities. However, today those same black cities are emerging in population, while the black identity decreases. Some of these cities are emerging in population – due to gentrification while the number of blacks is decreasing due to inequalities in education, income status, and educational opportunities, just to name a few.</p>

Some questions I would like to explore are:
* How gentrification is pushing blacks out of black cities?
* Where are black women living today according to their status?
* What are the best cities for black women for better income and educational opportunities?
* What cities are most likely to help black women out of poverty?
* What are the worst cities for women? (relating to inequalities in income, education, housing)

[What "Livability" Looks Like For Black Women  ](https://www.citylab.com/equity/2020/01/best-cities-black-women/604384/)

## Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* Yes - 4
	* The reporter examines the best and worst cities black women live in according to data collected from the largest metropolitan areas with more than 100,000 black residents. 
	* Yes
* Yes - 4
	* The reporter provides a ranked livability index from a previous study done by the University of Pittsburgh researchers to look at the inequalities for black women in terms of income status, health conditions, and education. The results are placed in charts – analyzed to show whether the outcome of each city is below or above the median. The reporter also includes related articles and studies to validate the data. 
	* The reporter should have provided more context on how urban sociologist Junia Howell conducted and analyzed where the best metros for black women are located based on the established ranked livability index from University of Pittsburgh researchers.
* 3
	* The rankings doesn't necessarily reflect the lived experiences of black women and can fail to consider other issues for black women. The data is only categorized by three issues. Gender and race inequalities can be driven by different factors.  
	* The reporter could provide more information about gender and race inequality across health, income, and education based on the population of that city/state. 
	* Yes
	* No 


## Objective: Quality

* 3
	* The reporters analyzed the largest metro areas for black women instead of every urban metro area in the U.S which allows readers to quickly summarize the data for the best and worst places for black women to live according to those three top factors. However, the charts provided could have provided numbers for the outcomes to really make a comparison. 
	* No
	* The chart could have provided the average numbers for each metropolitan area according to several outcome factors. 

## Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Yes, the reporter created a uniformed look and feel for all of the charts provided in the article. The font style is clean and guides the reader through the charts.  I would have liked the reporter to use blue in the charts instead of green. 
* 5 
	* The type color is black, uppercase,  and between 9-11 size font. The reporter also use a mix of boldness to creates a hierarchy within the text to guide the reader.

# Topic 2
<p>Rising STI Rates Among Maryland College Students: A recent study showed that Baltimore City has the highest sexually transmitted disease rates in the country, according to a study on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Per every 100,000 people, there were a reported 2,004 STD cases in Baltimore, which included mostly young adults ages 15-24 years old. Statewide, Maryland ranks 12 for cases of chlamydia, no. 24 for cases of gonorrhea, no. 12 for primary and secondary syphilis and ranks no. 9 for congenital syphilis. In those cases, minority communities are affected because of economic, social, and behavioral factors. </p> 

Some questions I would like to explore are:
* Should colleges require students to take Sex Education courses to decrease STD rates?
* What challenges do college campuses face as the STD rates spurge?
* What are the most common STDs among college students? 
* What are the top health disparities among this demographic? 
* Are health disparities related to inequalities in education?
* What resources are provided to students about safe sex and STD prevention? 

[CDC: Baltimore ranks #1 in top 20 U.S. cities with highest STD rates](https://www.wmar2news.com/news/region/baltimore-city/cdc-baltimore-ranks-1-in-top-20-u-s-cities-with-highest-std-rates)

## Objective: Clarity and accuracy
* Yes - 5
	* Baltimore City has the highest STD rates in U.S cities. 
	* Yes
* Yes - 4
	* Use the links provided by the reporter on the reports from  the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention and Innerbody.com. CDC released a 2018 STD surveillance report, along with new data on reported STD cases across U.S. countries and metro areas. Innberbody analyzed the CDC report on a city-by-city basis and developed their own list of the top cities with the highest STD rates. 
	* No
* 4
	* These were only STD cases that were reported in 2018; therefore, this doesn't include those who may have an STD but don't know it. 
	* I think the reporter provided the top two resources, but they could also check-in with Baltimore City Health department
	* Yes
	* The reporter summarized what was needed to support the goal of the article; however, the sources the reporter provided in the article further detailed the study with data and charts. 

## Objective: Quality
* 2
	* The reporter did well with providing sources to support; however, charts and pictures could have been included. 
	* No graphics were provided, just links.
	* It could have captured the data charts and pictures provided from both CDC and Innerbody.com, but missed the opportunity to really compare Baltimore among other cities on the list with rising STD rates.

## Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)
* The article did not include any graphics.
