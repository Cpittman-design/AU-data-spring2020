<p>The raw dataset I selected required cleaning due to the inconsistent spelling throughout the data sheet, but also the combined information in one column that should have been split. In column J and K, there was inconsistent spelling for the student school preference and school assigned, I corrected those changes by filtering those columns and updating the text for capitalization and misspelling. Also column A contained the combined date and time, which I separated into two columns.</p>
