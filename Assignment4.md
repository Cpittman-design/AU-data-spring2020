<p>I found that Maryland and California are the top political contributing states for Maryland’s 7th Congressional District candidates in the 2019-2020 election. With more than a dozen competing to serve as the U.S House Rep., Maryland favors Kweisi Mfume, while large donations from California poured in for Saafir Rabb.</p> 

<p>To follow up on this story, I would compare the individual contributions given to each candidate. I would then compare the top 3 candidates with the largest contribution size and break it down by state. Once it’s broken down by state, look at the contribution amount each state gave the candidate. I would then interview individuals from Maryland who donated to both Mfume and Rabb to see how they feel about out-of-state donations for running officials, and who benefits the most. This tory would probably take about 2-3 days.</p>  

In order to find my story, I did the following:
* Searched the FEC website for individual contributions in the 2019-2020 7th Congressional District of Maryland election. 
* Selected the top 3 candidates with the largest contributions. 
* Exported a CSV file of each candidate individual contributions.
* For the CVS files, I:
	*Filtered the “contributor_state” by each state 
	*Calculated the “contributor_aggregate_ytd” to get the total amount of contributions by each state.
	*Compared findings

## Hed:
After 24 years of leaving Congress, Marylanders still favor Kweisi Mfume for its 7th congressional district representative. 

## Nut graf:
 As the 7th district congressional race comes to a close, former U.S. Rep Kweisi Mfume and community activist Saafir Rabb reported the most raised donations from Maryland and California according to the Federal Election Commission report. 

Yet, Maryland residents are in favor of Mfume than his opponents, who received over 200 donations from residents than outside states.
