 <p>As the 2020 Census approaches, its goal is to count each person living in the United States starting on April 1. Officials are making a big push to college students and this data will guide decision-making and federal funding for the next decade for universities and states. The most important question is: College students and the census: Where do they count?</p>
 
<p>What I want to find is how this 2020 census report will benefit students at American University, what efforts are American University planning to engage their students in the report, and how do students feel about the report. Also, how much federal funding typically goes to American University and why do young people hold out on the census reports.</p> 
 
<p>To do this, I will use data from the census-derived datasets, which is used to distribute federal funds, as well as data from enrolled students at American university campus, along with pew research data census reports.</p>
 
<p>I could visualize the demographic of participants and non-participants from the Census reports, as well as the total number of students at American University, more particularly those who live on-campus.</p>
 
<p>This is timely because of the upcoming 2020 census report and the efforts colleges across the country are pushing because the census results could help to determine how much federal funding they will receive over the next 10 years.</p>
 
<p>For sources, I could talk to employees of American University Housing & Residence Life who know the occupancy of students who live on and off-campus. I will also talk to the Office of Campus Life who plans to participate in the 2020 census report on the university campus, along with students on campus.  Finally, talk with someone who will work directly in the 2020 census job recruit on college campuses.</p>
